[database]
; Type of database. Currently, the only supported value is "sqlite3".
type=sqlite3

; Location of the database.
; By default, this should point to the SourceMod local SQLite database, in:
; C:\SERVER_FULL_PATH_HERE\NeotokyoSource\addons\data\sqlite\sourcemod-local.sq3
;
; For Linux/WINE:
; The winepath utility may be helpful for figuring out the file system paths (maybe?)
; https://wiki.winehq.org/Winepath
location=D:\SteamNTDedi\neotokyo\NeotokyoSource\addons\sourcemod\data\sqlite\sourcemod-local.sq3

; If the database is locked, retry query this many times before giving up on it.
; Must be zero or a positive integer.
locked_max_retries=1000

[gameserver]
; Path to the SRCDS's maps folder.
; Should contain at least all of the maps (.bsp) we're looking to solve navigation paths for ("supported_maps_list").
maps_folder_path=D:\SteamNTDedi\neotokyo\NeotokyoSource\maps

[solver]
; Path where the .nav bot navigation mesh files are stored for all of the maps to solve nav paths for ("supported_maps_list").
;
; This path can be configured to be anywhere, but probably should not be the server's "maps" folder,
; as the server may then try to pointlessly serve those .nav files to clients on every connect.
navs_folder_path=D:\SteamNTDedi\neotokyo\NeotokyoSource\maps

; Comma delimited list of all the maps to solve navigation paths for.
; (Note that there cannot be any whitespaces in this value.)
;
; These maps need to have a .nav map calculated for it, accessible at the "navs_folder_path",
; and that .nav needs to have been been calculated using the identical map version as found in maps_folder_path
; (ie. cannot use a nav file of "nt_map_beta1" for "beta2" version of that same map; the nav needs to be re-generated).
supported_maps_list=nt_bullet_tdm,nt_oilstain_ctg,nt_sentinel_tdm,nt_terminal_ctg,nt_yau_tdm_v03d04m2020y

; Whether to print more informational debug messages.
; Error messages and warnings will be printed to stderr even if this is set to zero.
; Should be 0 or 1.
verbose_debug=0
